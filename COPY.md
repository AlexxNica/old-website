# PublicBits

Breaking down open data silos.

We want to collect all of the worldâ€™s open data and distribute it through a free, decentralized, redundant, and open network inspired by BitTorrent. PublicBits.org brings structure to the openness of data, making it easy to find, manage, and re-use the open data you use every day.

PublicBits.org collects all of the world's open data and distributes it through a free, decentralized, redundant, and open network inspired by BitTorrent. Users will have the option to automatically register open datasets with PublicBits, which will publish that metadata, including a link to the original data, for public benefit. We will automatically register data from hundreds of available data portals. PublicBits users may offer their unused bandwidth to mirror their previously-downloaded datasets for others, as a public service. If the original source goes offline, the data will still be downloadable. PublicBits.org brings structure to the openness of data, making it easy to find, manage, and re-use the open data you use every day.
