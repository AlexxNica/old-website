#  The likely collapse of a major proprietary hosting service
by [Karissa McKelvey](http://karissa.github.io)

**Proprietary services such as GitHub, Dropbox, PLOS, Figshare, and AWS provide data hosting at little-to-no charge. They pride themselves on the ease of sharing digital materials, positioning themselves as the most popular platforms for scientific collaboration. However, each falls victim to the plight of proprietary services -- when the money runs out, so does your data.**

Imagine a scenario fifteen years in the future, where most of the world's scientific data has been hosted on GitHub, and GitHub's business model collapses. How many owners of those open data repositories will take the time to download and find a new host for their data? How many university-hosted GitHub's will quickly become unsustainable? Who will provide a redirect service to those new repositories? I can imagine a variety of ways in which this scenario becomes a nightmare, even worse when confronted with the horror of losing a giant such as Amazon, Google Spreadsheets, or DropBox.


The average lifespan of a company has decreased from 67 years in the 1920s to just [15 years today](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-16611040). That means that if Newton published his Law of Gravitation on DropBox in 1666, it is highly likely that someone would have needed to move it anywhere from 11 to 33 times. Sound familiar? In practice, this is what actual libraries do. There's an incentive to create protection and redundancy in case of fire, natural disaster, war, or otherwise. Copying paper, as in copying data, is relatively free at first, but becomes cumbersome at scale. Although perhaps not good for business, copying is the only sure way to create redundancy in case of disaster (corporate or otherwise).

As we use an internet that depends increasingly on proprietary services, the implications for digital scientific data are grim. As we encourage the publicizing of open data, we need to concern ourselves heavily with the method. That's what we're focusing on with dat, and we're convinced that decentralized, open source tools are the right way forward to ensure longevity in data publishing. Additionally, we think it is crucial that copying data from the hosting service should not be prevented or require external tooling, but rather encouraged by design. *We need to make it easy to edit, copy, rehost, and redistribute the data.*

## But how did we get here in the first place?

Proprietary services use code that is closed source. Their business model depends heavily upon preventing users from running their own copy of the software and data. Universities often purchase private installations for GitHub, Dropbox, or Box, but users may not copy, distribute, study, change, or improve the software without prior permission. This is inconsistent with the values of science, which prides itself on the public and timeless nature of reproducible work.

It can take tremendous effort to move data stored on a proprietary service to a publicly and freely accessible copy. Amazon encourages users by making it free to upload data to cloud storage, but it costs money every time it needs to be downloaded. Although unfortunate, this market landscape is not necessarily the fault of companies (a topic for a different blog post). We just need to create open source alternatives and teach libraries how to use them. And we are -- albeit still falling behind Silicon Valley's immense trove of resources.

## A Call to Action

Scientists should stop relying on proprietary powered businesses and start relying on libraries (as in institutions, not code) powered by open source software. Scientists need access to platforms that allow anyone to can edit, study, copy, and redistribute the software, data, **and metadata** related to their published work and materials.

It is not surprising though, as business interests have always been able to secure larger finances than libraries. The good news, though, is that digital scientific publishing is still young, and the lack of tooling, knowledge, and resources available in open source has improved steadily since I first heard of this problem in 2011, and hopefully only improve with time and effort.
