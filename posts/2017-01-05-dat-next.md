# Dat Next Preview Release

Today we're announcing the release of Dat Next, our brand new Dat command line interface.

Dat Next provides a more familiar command line interface, a lot of under the hood improvements, and an early preview of the Dat dataset registry commands. We are seeking feedback on Dat Next as we prepare to release it as our main command line tool for long term support.

## Installing Dat Next

You can install Dat next with `npm`:

```
npm install -g dat-next
```

Once you get it installed run `dat` to see the usage guide or view more docs [on Github](https://github.com/joehand/dat-next).

## Under the Hood

We've been working on a lot of improvements to make your experience using Dat happier.

* Transfer data faster! In [hyperdrive](TODO) we have improved our replication algorithm for faster transfers with more improvements coming soon.
* A new Dat node module! We rewrote [dat-node](https://github.com/datproject/dat-node) to use in Dat Next. Dat node makes it easier to start creating applications to use the Dat ecosystem.
* A new doctor is in town! We've added another test to [dat-doctor](https://github.com/joehand/dat-doctor) to help with network debugging and fixing connection issues.

## Dat Archive Registry

Dat Next provides a glimpse of our registry work started as part of our [Knight Foundation](https://datproject.org/blog/2016-02-01-announcing-publicbits) grant. Once our registry is running you'll be able to publish and clone datasets, allowing you to use pretty names instead of a long `dat://` link. To try it out you can run `dat clone karissa/more-tweets-more-votes`.

New registrations for the Dat registry are currently limited. If you are very interested, please [send us a message](WHERE DOES THIS GO) and tell us about your use case.
